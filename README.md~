##Mini Web Apps
Haven't thought of a name though ! :P 
This repository will have some of my 'lukkha' web apps.
Feel free to contribute to it. Here's a list.

###QuoteMachine

Need to get inspired? This simple webapp fetches a random quote and displays it on the page with simple animations.

###WikiView

Wikipedia too clumsy? Try this. This app takes input from user and returns Wikiepdia articles.
